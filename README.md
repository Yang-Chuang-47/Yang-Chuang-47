I will die in the fear. I will die in the fear to death. I attempt to build my knowledge of death. However, I **should** know that the complete knowledge of death is physically impossible.

**Claim**：（Physically，）  
-Someone dead has no experience，and  
-Someone living has no death.

Consider the claim above.  
**A)** Physically,  
  This adverb shows that the claim is based on such an assumption: mind, which could be partially or totally non-physical, is supported by this physical world, and could not stand without this physical world.  
**B)** Someone dead has no experience，  
  Experience without mind is impossible. The physical ground of the mind of someone dead is dead.  
**C)** Someone living has no death.  
  Which means someone living has no experience of death. For those who has not yet died, the death has not yet happened. For those who restored their life after they had died, the death happened on themselves, but the death produces no experience.  

It requires something beyond the physical world to overcome my fear to death.

Consider the claim below.  
**A)** Physically，  
  the experience of death is impossible. That’s because we are either living or dead, and in either condition the experience of death is impossible.  
**B)** Death in the mind of someone living is impossible.  
  In case of the lacking of experience, someone living could never know what it is like to die. 

**Claim**：（Physically，）  
-Death in the mind of someone living is impossible.

I **should** know that the attempt to master death by my reason will never succeed. I have proved it to myself. Therefore, I will die in the fear. I will die in the fear to death.
